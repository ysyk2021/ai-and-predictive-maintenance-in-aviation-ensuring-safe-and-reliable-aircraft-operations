Introduction
------------

In this chapter, we will explore traditional approaches to aviation maintenance. These conventional methods have been widely used in the industry for decades and form the foundation of maintenance practices. We will discuss the key features, advantages, and limitations of traditional approaches, setting the stage for understanding the need for more advanced and proactive maintenance strategies like AI-driven predictive maintenance.

Reactive Maintenance
--------------------

Reactive maintenance, also known as "breakdown maintenance" or "run-to-failure," is a traditional approach where maintenance actions are taken after a failure occurs. This section will delve into the characteristics of reactive maintenance, including its reliance on addressing issues only when they impact aircraft operations. We will highlight the reactive nature of this approach, which can lead to increased downtime, unexpected failures, and potentially compromised safety.

Preventive Maintenance
----------------------

Preventive maintenance involves regularly scheduled inspections, replacements, and repairs to prevent potential failures from occurring. This section will discuss the principles and benefits of preventive maintenance. We will explore how routine tasks based on fixed time intervals or flight hours can help identify and address maintenance needs before they escalate into critical failures. However, we will also examine the limitations of preventive maintenance, such as the potential for over-maintenance and inefficient resource allocation.

Condition-Based Maintenance
---------------------------

Condition-based maintenance (CBM) relies on monitoring the condition of aircraft components and performing maintenance based on their actual state. This section will explain how CBM leverages real-time data collected from sensors, inspections, and other sources to make informed maintenance decisions. We will highlight the advantages of CBM, including cost savings through optimized maintenance planning and improved availability of aircraft for operations. However, we will also address challenges such as data collection, analysis, and the need for accurate condition monitoring techniques.

On-Condition Maintenance
------------------------

On-condition maintenance is another traditional approach that focuses on maintaining aircraft components until they exhibit specific indicators of degradation or wear. This section will discuss the principles behind on-condition maintenance and how it differs from preventive maintenance. We will explore the benefits of this approach, such as reducing unnecessary maintenance actions and optimizing resource allocation. However, we will also address the challenges associated with accurately identifying the specific indicators and potential risks of relying solely on condition monitoring.

Troubleshooting and Corrective Maintenance
------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting and corrective maintenance involve diagnosing and resolving specific issues identified during routine inspections or upon reporting by pilots or crew members. This section will discuss how troubleshooting aims to identify the root cause of a problem and perform corrective actions accordingly. We will highlight the importance of skilled technicians and their expertise in rapidly diagnosing and rectifying issues. However, we will also address the limitations of troubleshooting, including potential delays in identifying problems and the reactive nature of this approach.

Advantages and Limitations of Traditional Approaches
----------------------------------------------------

This section will provide an overview of the advantages and limitations associated with traditional approaches to aviation maintenance. We will emphasize the familiarity and established processes of traditional methods, which have been successfully applied for years. Simultaneously, we will address the limitations, including the potential for unexpected failures, suboptimal resource allocation, increased costs due to over-maintenance, reliance on subjective decision-making, and limited use of real-time data for proactive maintenance planning.

Conclusion
----------

Traditional approaches to aviation maintenance, including reactive maintenance, preventive maintenance, condition-based maintenance, on-condition maintenance, troubleshooting, and corrective maintenance, have served as the foundation for maintaining aircraft operations for many years. While these approaches offer familiarity and proven practices, they come with limitations that can result in safety risks, operational inefficiencies, and increased costs. Recognizing the advantages and limitations of traditional approaches sets the stage for understanding the need for more advanced and proactive strategies like AI-driven predictive maintenance, which will be explored in subsequent chapters.
