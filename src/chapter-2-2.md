Traditional Approaches to Aviation Maintenance
================================================================================================

The aviation industry has traditionally relied on two main approaches to maintenance - fixed schedule maintenance and reactive maintenance. While these approaches have been effective to some extent, they have several limitations that make them less efficient than predictive maintenance. This chapter will discuss traditional approaches to aviation maintenance.

Fixed Schedule Maintenance
--------------------------

Fixed schedule maintenance involves performing maintenance at pre-determined intervals, regardless of the actual condition of the aircraft component. For example, an aircraft engine may be serviced every 1000 flight hours, regardless of whether or not it actually requires maintenance.

While this approach ensures that maintenance is performed regularly, it can lead to unnecessary maintenance and increased costs. Additionally, it does not take into account the actual usage patterns and wear and tear of the aircraft components.

Reactive Maintenance
--------------------

Reactive maintenance involves performing maintenance only when an issue or failure occurs. For example, an aircraft landing gear may be repaired only when it fails to function properly.

While this approach may seem cost-effective, it can lead to unexpected downtime and safety incidents. Potential issues are not identified before they become major problems, leading to emergency repairs and increased costs.

Limitations of Traditional Approaches
-------------------------------------

There are several limitations of traditional approaches to aviation maintenance, including:

* Inefficiency: Traditional approaches to maintenance can be inefficient, as maintenance is either performed too frequently (fixed schedule) or not frequently enough (reactive).

* Increased Costs: Fixed schedule maintenance can lead to unnecessary maintenance and increased costs, while reactive maintenance can lead to unexpected downtime and emergency repairs.

* Safety Risks: Reactive maintenance can lead to safety incidents if potential issues are not identified before they become major problems.

* Lack of Data: Traditional approaches to maintenance do not leverage data analysis techniques to predict when maintenance is required based on usage patterns and component wear and tear.

Conclusion
----------

Traditional approaches to maintenance in the aviation industry, such as fixed schedule maintenance and reactive maintenance, have several limitations that make them less effective than predictive maintenance. While these approaches may still be used in some cases, more organizations are adopting predictive maintenance to reduce downtime, increase safety, and save costs.
