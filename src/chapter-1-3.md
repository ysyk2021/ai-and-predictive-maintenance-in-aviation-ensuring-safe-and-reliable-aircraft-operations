The aviation industry is constantly seeking ways to improve safety, reliability, and efficiency. One area where significant progress has been made in recent years is predictive maintenance using artificial intelligence (AI). AI-based predictive maintenance can help organizations predict when maintenance is required and identify potential faults early on, reducing downtime, increasing safety, and saving costs.

The objectives of this book are to provide an overview of AI and its applications in predictive maintenance in the aviation industry, examine the different types of AI and their applications, consider ethical considerations associated with the use of AI in predictive maintenance, and provide recommendations for organizations seeking to implement AI-based predictive maintenance programs.

Each chapter is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand, including background information, case studies, benefits and challenges, and recommendations for implementation. The structure of the book is intended to provide a clear and concise understanding of AI-based predictive maintenance in the aviation industry and enable organizations to make informed decisions about implementing these technologies to ensure safe and reliable aircraft operations.
