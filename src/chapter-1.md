Chapter 1: Introduction
=======================

The aviation industry is constantly evolving, with new technologies and approaches being developed to ensure safe and reliable aircraft operations. One such approach is AI-based predictive maintenance, which involves using data analysis techniques to predict when maintenance is required for aircraft components. This book will provide an overview of AI-based predictive maintenance in the aviation industry.

The Need for AI-Based Predictive Maintenance in Aviation
--------------------------------------------------------

Predictive maintenance is essential for ensuring safe and reliable aircraft operations in the aviation industry. By identifying potential faults early on, organizations can take action before they lead to major issues or safety incidents. However, traditional approaches to aviation maintenance have limitations and challenges that can make it difficult to accurately predict when maintenance is required. AI-based predictive maintenance offers a more accurate and efficient approach to maintenance scheduling.

Overview of Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications in Aviation Maintenance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Artificial intelligence (AI) involves using machine learning algorithms and other data analysis techniques to identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns. In the aviation industry, AI has applications in areas such as predictive maintenance, flight planning, and air traffic management. This book will focus specifically on the role of AI in predictive maintenance.
